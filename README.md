I saw a market gap in my area, exploring PG and rooms apart from the hostels aren't easy. There are no such place where a student could formaly visit to make an informed discision aboutwhich PG or room suits his/her best interest. Further I have developed it to address the problem of fooding with a system to formall rent food services. This project is ment to serve a student's as a one stop destination. We have also added bustimings and looking for future student help ideas.
